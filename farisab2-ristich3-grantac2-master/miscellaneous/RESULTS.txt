A one- to two-page final report describing the outcome of your project, including any discoveries made. Figures should be  
in the same directory (if using MDs) or the same file (if using PDFs) but are not included in the page limit.

When we took on this project, we set out with the goal of providing movie recommendations based on a dataset of Amazon movie reviews.
Our implementations of PageRank and Dijkstra's provides a succesful recommendation system based on all the reviews' rating of the movie
and the helpfulness of the reviews. In addition, we efficiently implemented a DFS algorithm to make sure that the dataset we used is valid.

Through our testing of multiple different inputs, we've discovered that despite using only numerical measures for each movie,  
the top recommendations for both algorithm's usually had at least 1 genre in common. This fact was extremely apparent for  
movies with popular genres (e.g. action-romance) which resulted in a lot of movie recommendations being from the same genre.  

Here's the output format for our 2 reccomendation algorithms:
PageRank:
[movieId] [PageRank rank]

Dijkstra's:
[movieId]

(Note the movieID must match the same length as those provided in the dataset as all Amazon product ID's consist of the same length of 10).

We've also included 2 screenshots of the output for each of the algorithms in this folder.
