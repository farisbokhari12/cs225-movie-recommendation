We met this week briefly to discuss how we wanted to parse the data and next steps for the project.
We've also implemented a graph class and uploaded a sample data set onto our github.
We haven't done much coding this past week due to being on break.

12/2/2020:
We've decided on some design implementations.
The user will input an Amazon Movie URL and we'll return the top 5 reviews based on helpfulness.

Graph implementation for our data:
With the movie review data, we've decided to make the vertices the ProductID + UserID.
Every edges will represent a review and it will be weighted by the helpfulness score.

12/4/2020:
Decided to change our Graph to be an undirected graph that has the weights as the helpfulness and the rating.
The graph is bipartite with one set of vertices as the movies and the other set reviewers.
We have chosen to use Dijkstra to provide a movie recommendation based on a movie given by a user.
The algorithm would find the shortest path between a movie and a reviewer that gave the movie a rating of 4 or higher
and has a helpfulness score above 20.

12/9/2020:
Finished implementing Dijkstras and DFS algorithms for our project. Also finished making the File Parser and Graph maker.

12/10/2020:
Completed PageRank algorithm for movie recommendations and have formatted the way user inputs information and how we return information.
